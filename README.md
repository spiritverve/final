### This is an assignment from the Getting and Cleaning Data class on Coursera.

The object of this assignment is to demonstrate my ability to create a tidy data set.

Information on this data set can be found at the following site: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data used can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This program will take the files containing accelerometer information and create a tidy data set containing the average only the variables containing mean and standard deviation for each subject and activity.

More information on the process and data can be found in the codebook.
